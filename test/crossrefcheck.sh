# ── 5b) §P11.5 — SOURCE files outrank docs, so the real definition leads ───────────────────────────────
#
# Before the fix the sort key was (HEAD, ref, isDef, path, line), so a doc path that sorts above the
# source path put doc-QUOTED code on the first screen: on this repo `--whereis=rankGraphTeleport` opened
# with three kind="def" rows into docs/captures/*.md CDATA and reached src/graph.h:1148 only on row four.
# The key now carries the path tier (source, then test, then doc) between the ref and isDef.
#
# HONESTY ARM, and it is the point: the §P11.5 tier change did NOT sharpen definitionShaped(). The doc row
# is still emitted — a gate that let it disappear would be asserting a lie. Only the PRINT ORDER changed.
#
# §A7 UPDATE (2026-07-28): what the doc row's kind= says on HEAD did change, and deliberately. HEAD rows are
# documented as the PARSED answer, so they are now labelled from the INDEX (head_labels="index"): the index
# holds no definition of computeBudget in AAA_design.md, so that row reads kind="ref". The lexical heuristic
# — and its documented residual, a quoted signature reading as a definition — still owns every NON-HEAD ref
# row, which is what arm 5's branch-only symbol above and test/selectorhonestycheck.sh both pin. The arm below
# was inverted rather than deleted: it is still the guard against the doc row being silently re-classified,
# it just now asserts the label the index actually justifies.
# The tier orders rows WITHIN one ref — the outer grouping (HEAD first, then refs by name) is unchanged
# and load-bearing — so the ordering arms read HEAD's block, which is where the doc file lives.

# engine.cpp:3, so the definitions page lists that line ONCE, on the first branch by name, with refs="3"
# (foldSharedBranchDefs); the whole list above (--whereis-listing=all, the untouched twin) still prints each
# branch's own row. The arm now asserts the fold's arithmetic instead of row-for-row equality: every def row of the
# default is a def row of the whole list, in the same order, and the refs= counts (1 when absent) add up to the
# whole list's def rows — nothing is dropped, it is counted.
#
# FIX ROUND 2 (rule 4, by design): a branch row is now a PARSER's label, and a branch holding HEAD's own engine.h blob
# takes HEAD's index labels: the index lists the prototype `int computeBudget( int frames );` (engine.h:2) as a
# definition site, so it is kind="def" on the three branches as it already was on HEAD (the lexical test called the
# same bytes a ref on the branches only, because the line ends in `;`). With 8 def rows against 3 refs the defs page
# is no longer the SHORTER one (2470 B vs 2439 B), so the default serves the whole list; this arm's subject is the
# defs page's fold arithmetic, so it asks for that page by name (--whereis-listing=defs). The default's choice keeps

# takes HEAD's index labels; any other blob holding a parse-worthy line is parsed by the index's own extraction
# (ingest.h definitionLinesInBlobs). The lexical shape test only CHOOSES blobs. One well-formed file per language family
# under head/ on main; byte-identical copies under sib/ on branch `sib` (another path: those blobs are PARSED, not
# mirrored); and under c1/ the definition shapes the round-1 lexical test lost (rv-whereis-defs-fix C1). Every line naming
# probeName carries @D (a definition) or @R (a reference). Two claims per marked line: the branch row says what the
# marker says, and it says what HEAD's index row says for the same bytes. RED on 93aeab1d (18 branch rows wrong: the C2
# call shapes read def) and on f1f11a7b (22: the C1 definition shapes read ref).
