// formembers.h — MEMBER NAMES on the owner rows of a compact-route --for answer (lane member-names, train 32).
//
// WHY. A compact --for answer (bodies="0") names a class/struct/interface as one <d> row: its declaration line, never what it
// holds. A question whose answer is a METHOD of a shown owner (mdbook's MDBook::execute_build_process, nunjucks' Context.addBlock,
// starlette's MultiPartParser.on_part_begin) then had the right owner on screen and the member nowhere: the reader had to --expand
// a 1,300-line class to find one name. mem= names the members on the owner row itself.
//
// WHAT. On a SHOWN owner row (ReceiverEvidence::classLike: class, struct, interface/trait) the row gains
//   mem="a,b,…"     up to kForMemberNameCap names of its DIRECT members, and
//   mem_more="N"    N more member names it did not list (absent when none was cut).
// A member is the parser's (fold_detail::sliceMembers = forowner.h isParsedMemberOf): a def whose index scope names the owner
// (a Rust/Go impl or receiver method, a C++ out-of-line definition, in any file) or whose span lies inside the owner's span in
// the same file (a C++ in-class declaration, a JS/TS/Python method), never one nested inside another member (a closure inside a
// method is that method's text). Only callables and fields (kMemberKinds) are named; a nested type is not a member name here.
// Order: the most question words (the fold's own words, sliceWords) in the name first, then the owner's own file before others,
// then declaration line. A name rides once (an overload, or a C++ declaration and its out-of-line definition, are one name).
// NOT listed: a name the answer already shows as a row (one of this owner's members ranked, or the owner's own name: a C++
// constructor), and a name a comma would split. Every member name not listed for another reason is counted in mem_more=.
//
// NOT ON: an owner whose text the answer already carries — a body the fold or the body slot serves holds it (the owner itself, or
// an enclosing body), or the fold served its member slice; an AMBIGUOUS owner (another class/struct/interface of the same name
// and a compatible language is indexed: a member's sc= cannot say which one it belongs to) — no list at all, never a guess.
//
// HONESTY. Names only: a name is index-proven containment or scope, never "relevant", never a call, never synthesised. The bytes
// ride on top of the ranked rows (the rows are chosen before the names are spliced, so a name never costs a row) and est_tokens
// prices them with the rest of <sigs>.
// Posture: the fold's — the compact route, XML, the DEFAULT regime (no explicit --token-budget: a size the caller named stays the
// answer it was). The name-exact route, --signatures-only, --json, --detail, --auto-bodies, --expand, the map and the file page
// carry none. RIPWIRE_NO_MEMBER_NAMES (any value) turns it off: the A/B handle.
